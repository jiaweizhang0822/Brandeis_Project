Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that *T*-1 would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital *T*-2 , *-3 creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers *T*-2 include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from *-4 raising temporary working capital by *-4 having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that *T*-3 would n't be counted *-1 on the federal budget .
The bill intends *-1 to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said *T*-1 Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes *-1 raising $ 30 billion *U* from debt issued * by the newly created RTC .
This financing system was created *-1 in the new law in order *-2 to keep the bailout spending from *-3 swelling the budget deficit .
Another $ 20 billion *U* would be raised *-1 through Treasury bonds , which *T*-2 pay lower interest rates .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital 0 * to maintain *T*-4 the bad assets of thrifts that *T*-3 are sold *-1 , until the assets can be sold *-2 separately .
That debt would be paid *-2 off as the assets are sold *-1 , * leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion *U* , or $ 166 billion *U* including interest over 10 years .
`` It 's a problem that *T*-2 clearly has *-3 to be resolved *-1 , '' said *T*-4 David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion *U* *-2 selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely *-3 to sell or merge 600 by the time 0 the bailout concludes *T*-1 .
Absent other working capital , he said 0 *T*-2 , the RTC would be forced *-3 to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised *-1 by * selling the bad assets .
`` We would have *-1 to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said *T*-2 .
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion *U* at any time .
Moreover , it says 0 the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion *U* , but that figure is derived *-1 after * including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets 0 the RTC holds *T*-2 .
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say 0 *T*-1 opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said 0 the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in *-2 not keeping Congress informed .
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which *T*-1 seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said *T*-2 .
`` The RTC is going *-1 to have *-2 to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
We 're about *-1 to see if advertising works .
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that *T*-1 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : * Keep on *-2 investing , the market 's just fine .
Their mission is * to keep clients from *-1 fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads * to calm investors .
This time around , they 're moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered *-2 running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided *-2 not to *?* when the market recovered yesterday *T*-1 .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic *T*-1 .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall *T*-1 Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . ''
A Fidelity spokesman says 0 the 800-line , which *T*-1 already was operating but which many clients did n't know about *T*-2 , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says *T*-1 .
`` * To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late 0 * to think about *T*-1 on Friday .
We had *-1 to think about it ahead of time . ''
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , *-1 encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need *-1 to know 0 their portfolios are balanced *-2 * to help *-3 protect them against the market 's volatility . ''
It goes on *-1 to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able *-1 to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began *-1 taping commercials in-house , *-1 ultimately getting its timing down fast enough * to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree *-1 to air its last-minute creations *T*-2 .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created * with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .
* Taped *-1 just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as *-2 going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
We continue *-1 to feel that the stock market is still the place 0 * to be *T*-2 for long-term appreciation . ''
The spot was scheduled *-1 to appear three times on CNN last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , * recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on *-2 just urging the clients who *T*-1 are its lifeline *-3 to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying 0 the worst thing that anyone can do *T*-2 is * to see the market go down and dump everything , which *T*-1 just drives the prices down further , '' says *T*-3 John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited * . ''
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had *-1 to constantly revise their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had *-1 to regroup yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been * to make one of Shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` Where We Stand *T*-2 '' commercials , which *T*-1 have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , *-1 replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example . ''
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided *-1 not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
`` We do n't think at this point 0 anything needs *-2 to be said *-1 .
The market seems *-1 to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says *T*-2 Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster *ICH*-2 *-1 to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it *EXP*-2 remains * to be seen *-3 whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .
Now the firms must try their hardest *-1 to prove that advertising can work this time around .
Ad Notes ... .
ARNOLD ADVERTISING :
Edward Eskandarian , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS\/Boston , reached an agreement *ICH*-1 in principle * to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop .
Terms were n't disclosed *-1 .
Mr. Eskandarian , who *T*-4 resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .
John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million *U* cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area .
That account had been handled *-1 by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .
EDUCATION ADS :
A 142-page ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate Elite '' issue calls on business leaders * to use their clout *-1 to help *-2 solve the nation 's education crisis .
The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education .
The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
You know what the law of averages is *T*-1 , do n't you *?* ?
It 's what 1 -RRB- *T*-3 explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson *T*-4 ; 2 -RRB- *T*-3 cautions that it *EXP*-1 's possible * to drown in a lake that *T*-2 averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- *T*-3 predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed * before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .
Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that *T*-2 dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held *-1 to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that *T*-3 had been done unto *-4 similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .
Morever , much of the damage was accomplished *-1 by A 's who *T*-2 had some catching up 0 * to do *T*-3 .
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done *-1 by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .
He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four *-2 to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed *T*-1 .
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked *T*-1 .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes *-1 to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits *ICH*-3 in four at bats , two more than he 'd had *?* in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 *T*-2 .
The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision .
Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits *-1 to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates 0 he may have some evening up coming , but with the way 0 his split-fingered fastball is behaving *T*-1 , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who *T*-1 overcame early struggles *-2 to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
`` Every guy 0 they put *T*-1 out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled *T*-2 Giant manager Roger Craig .
He 's an ex-hurler who *T*-1 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which *T*-2 looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest .
The stat 0 * to reckon with *T*-2 here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that *T*-1 took 2-0 Series leads went on *-3 to win it all .
That 's not an average 0 *T*-1 to soothe Giant rooters .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called * BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
A few folks even showed up *-1 wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love 'em both .
The only thing 0 I 'm rooting for *T*-1 is for the Series to go seven games , '' said *T*-2 David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
I choose *-1 to believe 0 it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
* Suffice it * to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat *-1 to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes 0 * to root for *T*-1 .
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who *T*-1 had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
Such *ICH*-2 is *T*-5 his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season *T*-3 , the fan who *T*-1 caught it agreed *-4 to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .
Not his autograph ; power-hitter McGwire 's .
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who *T*-1 exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation .
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by *-1 going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
`` When you 're in the groove *T*-1 , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured *T*-2 .
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in * in the five games against the Cubs .
They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that *T*-1 gives the Giants hope in the Series games 0 *T*-2 to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared *T*-1 San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .
`` I 'd rather *ICH*-3 see a so-so hitter who *T*-1 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who *T*-2 's cold . ''
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side *T*-1 .
`` When it goes *T*-1 , you never know when you 'll get it back *T*-2 , '' he said *T*-3 .
`` That 's baseball .
NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , *-2 citing intense competition that *T*-1 caused its gross profit margins to dip .
Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million *U* from $ 103.1 million *U* , roughly what analysts had expected *T*-1 .
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 *U* a share from $ 1.26 *U* a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .
Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million .
Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion *U* from $ 1.41 billion *U* .
The computer maker , which *T*-2 sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said 0 the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it *EXP*-1 difficult '' * to better 1988 results .
NCR said 0 revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , * reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
The company , however , said 0 orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % *U* , a good part of it coming from large orders placed * by a few of NCR 's major customers .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which *T*-2 sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected *-1 by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that *T*-3 have generally not been robust , '' notes 0 *T*-4 Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said 0 *T*-1 .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million *U* , or $ 1.85 *U* a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion *U* .
Mr. Hingorani said 0 he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 *U* a share from $ 5.50 *U* a share .
Revenue projections were slashed *-1 to $ 6.03 billion *U* from $ 6.20 billion *U* .
Last year , NCR had net income of $ 439.3 million *U* , or $ 5.33 *U* a share , on $ 5.99 billion *U* in revenue .
For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million *U* , or $ 3.40 *U* a share , from $ 289.7 million *U* , or $ 3.49 *U* a share .
Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion *U* from $ 4.19 billion *U* .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents *-1 to close at $ 57 *U* .
* Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
If the firms are serious , however , why * limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability * to see into the future *T*-1 is fragile at best *T*-2 ?
Why not * extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based * on how much money they made *T*-1 for their clients during the year *T*-2 ?
That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven * only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
Now , would n't that be a novelty .
Phyllis Kyle Stephenson Newport News , Va .
Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .
`` I had calls *ICH*-1 all night long from the States , '' he said *T*-2 .
`` I was woken *-1 up every hour -- 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 , 4:30 .
People are looking for possible opportunities * to buy , but nobody wants *-1 to stick their chin out . ''
For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that *T*-1 started nervously in the small hours .
By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever .
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief .
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered *-1 especially vulnerable .
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be *T*-1 .
By the time 0 trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. *T*-1 , the news from Asia was in .
And it left mixed signals for London .
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % .
`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said *T*-2 Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who *T*-1 runs the 15-trader office .
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , *-1 seeking *-2 to avoid risk .
`` This is not the sort of market 0 * to have a big position in *T*-2 , '' said *T*-3 David Smith , who *T*-1 heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .
`` We tend *-1 to run a very tight book . ''
Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning *-1 trying *-2 to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .
`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted *-2 this morning , '' Mr. Smith said *T*-1 .
Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in .
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area *-1 to have a cigarette .
On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , * let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said *T*-1 .
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button *-1 to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 *U* -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started *-1 putting out feelers .
But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated * by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
`` When I want *-2 to buy *T*-1 , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said *T*-3 .
`` It 's very frustrating . ''
He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares .
By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which *T*-1 had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .
`` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , *T*-1 almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ...
we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . ''
He was right .
By midday , the London market was in full retreat .
`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said *T*-2 Danny Linger , a pit trader who *T*-1 was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .
Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television .
At 12:49 p.m. , the index hit its low , 2029.7 , off 204.2 points .
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't *T*-1 , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said *T*-2 early in the afternoon .
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended *-1 , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
This market has been very badly damaged *-1 . ''
As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open *T*-2 .
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- *-1 plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
They saw an opportunity created * by the sell-off .
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them *-1 to resell in the U.K .
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied .
`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted *T*-1 one trader at about 3:15 London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout .
As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild .
Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street .
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' shouted *T*-1 Shearson trader Andy Rosen , *-2 selling more Jaguar shares .
`` This is panic buying ! ''
As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .
The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off 70.5 , or about 3.3 % .
Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement -LRB- Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 -RRB- , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that *T*-1 has one chance in a million of * going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of * looking at things .
Is n't it *EXP*-1 just as fair * to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that *T*-2 has one chance in a million of * going right will go right at least once a year ?
* Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador .

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that *T*-1 would give the transportation secretary authority * to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
The collapsed plan * to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced * Wednesday and approved * by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
The bill is expected *-2 to be taken *-3 up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged *-1 .
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who *T*-1 yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort * to thwart his bid for AMR , and said 0 it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter 0 *T*-1 to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''
Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
He also said 0 the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated 0 there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .
Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons * to move quickly *-1 to enact this legislation .
Aides both in the House and Senate said 0 the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely *-1 to deflate efforts * to push the legislation .
`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want *-1 to do it , '' said *T*-2 one Senate aide .
The bill is aimed *-1 at * addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures *-2 to pay off the debt incurred * in a leveraged buy-out .
Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of * revoking the operating certificate of any carrier 0 the official considers *T*-1 unfit .
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort * to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and * to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired *-1 .
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to * determining the intent of the acquisition .
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided *-1 , or if the buy-out is likely *-2 to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
If more information is needed *-1 , the secretary would have authority * to extend the review period 20 days .
All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order * to prevent profiteers from *-1 cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .
But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .
One of the major concerns expressed * by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited *-1 from *-2 divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies .
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said 0 representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said *T*-2 Doug Hammond , the mediator , who *T*-1 called the agreement * to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .
`` We 're encouraged *-3 that talks are scheduled *-1 again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said *T*-2 .
The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that *T*-1 would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .
Currently , average pay for machinists is $ 13.39 *U* an hour , Boeing said 0 *T*-1 .
Now in its 13th day , the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started *-1 to delay delivery of some jetliners .
With a strike fund of about $ 100 million *U* , the union had said 0 it was prepared *-1 for a long strike .
After the third week on strike , union members will begin *-1 receiving $ 100 *U* a week from the fund .
Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines .
And at the company 's Wichita , Kan. , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working , Boeing said 0 *T*-1 .
Under Kansas right-to-work laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
Boeing has declined *-2 to say how many employees *T*-1 are working at its giant Renton , Wash. , plant .
Union officials could n't be reached *-1 for comment .
DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , said 0 it intends *-1 to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock .
DPC , a group led * by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc. , also said 0 it plans *-2 to file preliminary materials *ICH*-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation * to oust Dataproducts ' board .
DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share *U* bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million *U* proposal unacceptable .
A DPC spokesman declined *-1 to elaborate on the group 's new plan .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents *-1 to close at $ 9.375 *U* .
Dataproducts , which *T*-1 had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .
The company 's restructuring includes plans * to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary .
As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact * to sell $ 63 million *U* of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc. , a unit of Canada 's Trizec Corp .
Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said 0 the company `` is at a loss *-1 to understand DPC 's intentions . ''
He called today 's announcement `` opportunistic and disruptive '' and said 0 the company intends *-1 to proceed with its restructuring .
Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout .
European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound .
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which *T*-1 closed before the New York exchanges opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping 12.8 % .
In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before *-1 coming back strong after the New York opening *-2 to close down only 3.2 % .
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based *-1 on fundamentals .
The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . ''
Paris , which *T*-2 has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit *-1 .
Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm .
Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading *T*-1 , also tumbled .
*-1 Following is a breakdown of major market activity :
FRANKFURT :
One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy .
The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , * wiping out the summer 's gains .
The index closed at 1385.72 , down 203.56 points .
By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the exchange .
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's * losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake .
This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt *-1 by *-2 acting so swiftly .
`` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said *T*-1 Andreas Insam , an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein 's Frankfurt branch .
He said 0 he told clients *-1 to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % .
After the opening was delayed *-1 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal two-hour trading session was extended *-2 75 minutes *-2 to handle the heavy volume .
`` The beginning was chaotic , '' said *T*-1 Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank AG .
`` It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked *-1 out * to get a reading on the market . ''
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom *T*-1 spent the night before in their offices *-2 watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .
`` Everybody *ICH*-1 was still confident , including most institutional investors .
That is why everybody was a little surprised *-1 by the storm of sell orders from small private investors *T*-2 , '' said *T*-3 Norbert Braeuer , a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank .
Some big institutions , including banks , began *-2 picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted *-3 to see what *T*-1 would happen in New York before *-4 acting .
But even if Wall Street continues *-2 to stabilize , analysts here say 0 the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which *T*-1 already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8 .
Some of West Germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits .
A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November *T*-1 could now be in jeopardy .
Dresdner Bank last month said 0 it hoped *-1 to raise 1.2 billion marks -LRB- $ 642.2 million *U* -RRB- by *-2 issuing four million shares at 300 marks each .
Yet yesterday 's market cropped Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share , * leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly .
LONDON :
*-1 Headed toward a record drop at midday , the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York 's early rally .
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off 70.5 points , at 2163.4 , its high for the day , after *-1 having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m .
It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group , Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that *T*-1 spearheaded the rally .
*-1 Attracted *-2 by low prices and encouraged *-2 by New York 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board .
Volume was 959.3 million shares , more than triple recent levels .
PARIS :
Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day .
The CAC General Index ended down 5.4 % at 523.6 , a drop of 29.6 points from Friday .
`` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen *T*-1 before , '' said *T*-2 Michel Vigier , a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont .
`` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening *T*-1 , there was panic buying in Paris . ''
Brokers said that as the news *ICH*-3 spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who *T*-4 had called *-1 to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation , *-2 ordering buys instead .
Trading was driven *-1 primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day .
When Wall Street turned *T*-1 , however , the big boys entered the market , *-2 looking for bargains .
J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported 0 net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % .
J.P. Morgan & Co .
J.P. Morgan , as * expected *-1 , posted a $ 1.82 billion *U* net loss for the quarter , * reflecting the New York bank 's decision *ICH*-2 last month * to add $ 2 billion *U* to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that *T*-1 have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
The latest quarter 's loss equals $ 9.92 *U* a share .
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ 233.6 million *U* , or $ 1.25 *U* a share .
George M. Salem , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing . ''
*-3 Excluding the $ 2 billion *U* provision and allowing for the taxes 0 Morgan paid *T*-1 , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said 0 *T*-2 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 *U* a share to $ 44.125 *U* .
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million *U* from $ 347 million *U* .
The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow *T*-1 *-3 to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said 0 *T*-2 .
Morgan received $ 2 million *U* of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million *U* higher in the quarter , Morgan said 0 *T*-1 .
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , *-1 costing the bank $ 10 million *U* of interest income in the third period .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million *U* , * reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
`` These increases were partly offset *-1 by lower trading-related '' income , the bank said 0 *T*-2 .
Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million *U* .
NCNB Corp .
NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations .
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said 0 earnings rose to $ 143.6 million *U* , or $ 1.45 *U* a share , from $ 58.9 million *U* , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million *U* , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million *U* , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million *U* , or 1.13 % in the second quarter .
Nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million *U* , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter .
Included *-4 in the increase in the most recent quarter is *T*-3 a $ 33 million *U* loan , which NCNB said 0 it `` expects *T*-2 to be fully repaid *-1 , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . ''
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
The higher rates paid * on deposits also helped *-1 squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ 3.50 *U* a share , to $ 51 *U* .
Results were released *-1 after the market closed .
NCNB Texas National , formed * from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million *U* to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter .
NCNB said 0 its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 .
NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion *U* in new capital during the quarter *-1 to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts *-2 to fill out its regional franchise .
Last week , the banking company said 0 it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million *U* .
In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million *U* , or $ 3.30 *U* a share , from $ 188.2 million *U* , or $ 2.22 *U* a share , a year earlier .
Security Pacific Corp .
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able *-1 to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
Net rose to $ 185.1 million *U* , or $ 1.55 *U* a share , from $ 167.9 million *U* , or $ 1.47 *U* a share , a year earlier .
The company said 0 the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million *U* increase in net interest income , * reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which *T*-1 were allowed *-2 to decrease .
As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which *T*-1 have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
Security Pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 *U* , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading .
The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity .
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market .
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million *U* from $ 81.9 million *U* in the year-ago period .
Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion *U* at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion *U* a year ago .
Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million *U* , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before .
Non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations .
Non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million *U* , or $ 4.67 *U* a share , from $ 469.4 million *U* , or $ 4.13 *U* a share , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said 0 it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer *ICH*-1 by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. * to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .
The new offer , which *T*-1 seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 *U* a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process *ICH*-1 in July 1994 that *T*-2 would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have *-4 to pay *T*-3 for all of LIN .
LIN is asking McCaw *-2 to clarify its tender offer , which *T*-1 challenges an agreement *ICH*-3 between BellSouth Corp. and LIN * to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as * is warranted *-1 . ''
The LIN board said 0 holders may be misled *-1 by the provision in the McCaw proposal that *T*-2 `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares .
McCaw has `` no obligation * to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said 0 *T*-1 .
The board added that McCaw would be able *-2 to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which *T*-1 could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years . ''
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ 104.75 *U* , down $ 2.75 *U* .
A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ 18-a-share *U* offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . ''
In a letter filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which *T*-1 holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes 0 an offer for less than $ 25 *U* per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 *U* is too low . ''
The letter was dated *-1 Oct. 6 .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed yesterday at $ 18.875 *U* , down 75 cents a share .
Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ 18-a-share *U* , or $ 576 million *U* , tender offer * to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
Telerate has rejected the offer , which *T*-1 expires Nov. 3 .
The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based * in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore .
Among other issues , the group 's letter said 0 it has `` concerns as to whether Dow Jones 's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness . ''
A spokesman for Dow Jones said 0 he had n't seen the group 's filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions .
Our offer is * to buy any and all shares tendered * at $ 18 *U* a share .
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said 0 the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
Mrs. Hills said 0 the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 *-1 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n't reached *-1 by then , she said *T*-2 , the U.S. would have the right * to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered * by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said 0 the dispute-settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use *ICH*-1 of these landing requirements * to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''
*-1 Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said 0 the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''
The U.S. trade representative declined *-1 to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
Canada initially had an export prohibition that *T*-3 was replaced *-1 by regulations requiring that such fish had *-4 to be brought *-2 ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
This action was defended *-1 by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended *-1 , she said 0 *T*-2 .
Earlier , an international panel set * up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules .
Mrs. Hills said 0 the U.S. wo n't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish-processing firms enter into contracts *ICH*-1 in the fall * to purchase the next season 's catch .
She said 0 the Canadian restrictions must be removed *-1 before such contracts are concluded *-2 .

BancOklahoma Corp. said 0 it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to * by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders .
The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity .
The FDIC , which *T*-1 in 1986 provided $ 130 million *U* in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma 's Bank of Oklahoma , Tulsa , unit will continue *-2 to maintain $ 90 million *U* in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit .
In exchange for the other $ 40 million *U* , the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60 % of BancOklahoma 's common stock outstanding , up from the 55 % option 0 the FDIC received *T*-1 under terms of the 1986 capital infusion .
In exchange for the $ 76 million *U* 0 they are owed *-1 *T*-2 , creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers , the bank holding company said 0 *T*-3 .
Also under the agreement , debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million *U* in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma 's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred 0 they own *T*-1 , the company said 0 *T*-2 .
Bear Stearns 's chief economist , Lawrence Kudlow , in the Sept. 29 issue of the firm 's Global Spectator :
Were it *EXP*-1 true that a weak currency paves the way for trade surpluses , then presumably Argentina would be the center of today 's global economy .
BSN Corp. said 0 it will begin an offer *ICH*-1 tomorrow * to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $ 16.6 million *U* in 7 3\/4 % convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants .
Under terms of the offer , the sporting goods maker will swap $ 9 *U* face amount of 9 1\/4 % subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share .
Each warrant allows the holder to buy one BSN share for $ 10.75 *U* a share at any time over the next seven years .
BSN currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding .
BSN also is offering $ 850 *U* face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount of its convertible debt outstanding .
The company said 0 it can redeem the warrants at its option for $ 1 *U* each .
The offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged * .
BSN said 0 it is making the offer *-1 to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value .
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , BSN will increase its debt by $ 9 million *U* , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million *U* gain from * retiring the old debt , said 0 *T*-1 Michael J. Blumenfeld , president .
`` We have sufficient cash flow 0 *T*-1 to handle that , '' he said *T*-2 .
The offers are scheduled *-1 to expire in mid to late November .
Merrill Lynch & Co. 's net income dropped 37 % , while Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 7.5 % gain in net , and PaineWebber Group Inc. 's profit fell , but would have risen without a special gain a year ago .
At Merrill Lynch , third-period net was $ 41 million *U* , or 34 cents a share , down from $ 65.6 million *U* , or 58 cents a share , a year ago .
Total revenue reached $ 2.83 billion *U* , up 10 % from $ 2.57 billion *U* .
The firm 's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account -- a decline of 19 % to $ 314.6 million *U* on reduced revenue from * trading fixed-income securities .
Investment banking revenue fell 22 % to $ 296.6 million *U* on fewer equity and municipal underwritings .
Merrill Lynch 's commission revenue grew 21 % , however , to $ 462.8 million *U* , on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds .

Purchase of the 76-story structure is subject to execution of a definitive agreement , approval by the boards of Seafirst and its parent company BankAmerica Corp. , and approval by regulators .
The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who *T*-1 speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive *T*-2 ; those investors often borrow heavily *-3 to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
But several large banks said yesterday 0 they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that *T*-1 would signal such difficulties .
`` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said *T*-1 one official at a Top 10 bank .
`` That 's good news , because we all swim in this water . ''
Added *ICH*-2 another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little goosey over the weekend *-3 trying *-4 to forecast what *T*-1 would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet .
Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who *T*-1 knows ?
What *T*-1 happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated *-2 *-3 to handle another meltdown in prices .
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from *-1 suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it *EXP*-1 would be wise * to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose *T*-2 .
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours .
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It *EXP*-2 is impossible * to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from *-1 feeding on itself .
But there is also the possibility that * shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What *T*-1 happened Friday was the worst of all worlds .
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
With nowhere else 0 * to go *T*-1 , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided *-1 and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted *-1 altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which *T*-2 is the daily limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled *-2 by the New York Stock Exchange .
It is time 0 * to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined *-2 as *-3 to constitute one market effectively *T*-1 .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It *EXP*-1 therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
* To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .

* CLUBBING A FAN was n't the Baltimore Orioles ' fault .
So said *T*-1 a federal judge , in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield , Va. , Orioles , a Baltimore farm team .
The players were heckled *-1 by a patron during a July 4 , 1988 , game with the Martinsville Phillies .

Yesterday was , in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. , just your `` reasonably normal , 400 million-share , up 88-points day . ''
When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery *T*-1 , Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone *T*-2 .
They said 0 the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better .
`` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. Phelan said *T*-1 after the market closed .
`` All the things that we set up *T*-1 *-2 to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ''
Prices for the 416.3 million shares that *T*-2 changed hands during the session were carried *-1 on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said 0 *T*-3 .
While *-2 reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said 0 it can handle *T*-1 daily since *-3 beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash .

Chicken Chains Ruffled *-1 By Loss of Customers
FAST-FOOD chicken chains , faced * with a worsening business slump , are struggling *-1 to hatch some new marketing strategies .
The Crest Report , which *T*-1 tracks consumer purchases , says 0 customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter , while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2 % .
Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food , home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says 0 *T*-1 a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems .
Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. , which *T*-2 have merged , are still troubled *-1 by overlapping restaurant locations .
Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which *T*-1 introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken .
New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd .
And the chain is testing products that *T*-2 are n't fried *-1 , such as `` char-grilled '' chicken , *-4 to try *-3 to win health-conscious consumers .
Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken , which *T*-1 could be a hit with stay-at-home diners .
But some fast-food industry analysts say 0 problems with * keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved *-1 first .
A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued *-1 *T*-2 .
He says 0 the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities .
The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency .
But the company declines *-1 to comment .
Emanuel Goldman , a PaineWebber Inc. analyst , predicts 0 Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11 % drop in 1989 net income .
`` They 've been laggard , '' he says *T*-1 , `` but they 'll have *-2 to become more aggressive . ''
Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft-Sell Spots
* CALL IT un-advertising .
Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who *T*-1 want exposure yet shun pushy ads .
His ploy : 60-second radio spots that *T*-1 offer helpful hints .
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
The messages resemble the Business Traveler , a daily dose of travel tips developed * by Mr. Bear and sponsored * by travel agencies in several major cities .
New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates , a Butler , Pa. , architectural firm .
Its radio series features such spots as `` Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures '' and `` * Building a Place 0 * to Park *T*-1 . ''
A harder sell , says 0 *T*-1 John Kosar , the firm 's president , would `` detract from the profession . ''
Hospitals have signed up *-1 to use the messages *-2 to promote fundraisers , and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format *-3 to offer energy tips to consumers .
But such spots can be too soft .
`` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says *T*-2 John Fitzgerald , chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA , which *T*-1 created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank .
`` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain *T*-1 for the possible loss of recognition . ''
Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
HERE 'S *T*-2 a retailer that *T*-1 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
Big Bear Supermarkets Inc. , a grocery chain based * in San Diego , plans *-2 to display shelf cards *RNR*-1 and distribute pamphlets *RNR*-1 recommending products deemed * safe for the environment .
The choices will be based *-1 on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners .
But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements .
For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list .
That does n't thrill Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent .
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , *-1 noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents .
In fact , Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed *-1 on the label for the powder version .
Thomas G. Dahlen , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said 0 the chain is still reviewing its product list *-1 to avoid such problems .
`` Our intent is * to promote the best alternative , '' he says *T*-1 .
`` And it *EXP*-1 's important that we be accurate . ''
But in the end , customers ' wishes are what *T*-1 will prevail .
Big Bear does n't care for disposable diapers , which *T*-1 are n't biodegradable .
Yet parents demand them .
Says *ICH*-3 Mr. Dahlen , `` We 'll still be forced *-1 to sell items 0 we might not philosophically agree with *T*-2 . ''

She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics .
Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders -LRB- NAHB -RRB- continue *-1 to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending .
Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that *T*-1 will be `` very difficult '' * to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''
There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
But the NAHB was created *-1 in 1943 out of an organization that *T*-2 made its name *-3 fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal * to take over all defense housing production .
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , *-1 pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment .
Yet on matters close to , er , home ...
`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues *T*-1 Mr. Colton .
`` We 've taken more than our fair share .
I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''
But NAHB support for subsidies is not related *-1 to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs .
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set * by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .
Moreover , explains *T*-2 one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that *T*-1 specialize in subsidized production .
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which *T*-1 would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion *U* annually .
It would like *-2 to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of *-3 limiting it to $ 101,250 *U* ; reduce *RNR*-1 -LRB- or even eliminate *RNR*-1 -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion *U* in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million *U* potpourri for the homeless .
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted *-1 to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as * demonstrated *-2 by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .
Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .
Though Mr. Colton says 0 * expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
More important , housing programs run * by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink .
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion *U* in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion *U* .
The federal government has had *-1 to pump in $ 2.28 billion *U* into the VA housing program since 1984 *-2 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million *U* for the fiscal year just ended .
All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion *U* of mortgages .
In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live *T*-2 ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided *-1 by the federal government . ''
It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which *T*-1 pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people .
But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take *T*-1 *-3 to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , * say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- 0 *T*-2 to eliminate counterproductive controls .
The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members *T*-1 build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies .
Explains *ICH*-1 Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union : `` It treads in two worlds .
The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend *-1 to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . ''
Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends *-1 to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .
Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion *U* omnibus housing bill *T*-1 , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says 0 *T*-2 Ms. MacDonald .
As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges *T*-1 : `` Government is not going *-2 to solve the problem ... .
The real key is * to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that *T*-1 are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
Is this what the home builders want *T*-1 ?

In an attempt * to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely *-1 to agree *-2 to set a date for * starting formal talks on * amending the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome .
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .
The only strong opposition to * changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who *T*-2 is opposed *-1 to * creating a single EC currency .
But the process of * convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
* Setting a date 0 * to start treaty negotiations *T*-1 has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
French President Francois Mitterrand fought *-2 to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled *-1 because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
Diplomatic sources said 0 Mr. Kohl may now agree *-3 to set a date for the conference *-3 to make it *EXP*-1 clear that West Germany is still committed *-2 to EC unity .
The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke 0 T. Boone Pickens tells *T*-2 about the guy who *T*-1 was run *-3 over by the parade .
When *-3 asked `` *-4 What *T*-1 went wrong *T*-2 ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''
And so it was *T*-1 on Gray Friday .
The grand marshal of this parade would appear *-1 to have been excess leverage .
Even if that is so , however , it *ICH*-1 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected *-2 *-3 to stop the procession before the end of the rout -LRB- e -RRB- .
The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word *ICH*-2 spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing *T*-1 .
Although the union-bidder expects *-1 to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure * to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear *ICH*-2 among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .
Lots of other entries *ICH*-2 made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in * trying *-1 to lower the capital-gains tax .
As usual , few favorable reviews *ICH*-3 were heard *-1 for that ever-present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest 0 they only play the music that others write *T*-2 .
What *T*-1 really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up .
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized *-1 by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
UAL , which *T*-1 triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 *U* , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .
AMR opened Monday at $ 80 *U* , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .
-LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB-
Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % .
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured *-1 *T*-3 , the target 's stock price was not affected *-2 on Friday .
The multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high-yield debt *T*-2 , were where the damage was concentrated *-1 *T*-3 .
The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .
Investors have reacted by *-1 ignoring recent efforts * to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by *-1 forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .
As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning * to sell $ 11 billion *U* in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .
These are all market excesses -LRB- * putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives *T*-1 to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen *T*-2 is the market reining them in .
Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency * to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that *T*-1 was at work on Friday .
If it *ICH*-1 is correct * to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are *T*-2 the implications for policy makers ?
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken *-1 to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street *T*-1 ?
Absolutely not .
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of *-1 imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
The national economic interests are much better served *-1 * allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of * letting the free markets operate .
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will *?* policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed *-1 to impose appropriate sanctions .
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .
Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed *-1 on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .
If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely *-1 to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more *-2 to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated *-1 .
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed *-1 too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .
Any such attempt * to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely *-2 to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides *T*-1 both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that *T*-1 seem *-2 never to end .

Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points *-1 to close the morning session at 35087.38 .
The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .
In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points , to 35133.83 .
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally .
Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that *T*-1 did n't provide much direction for other markets .
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began *-1 to rebound in New York .
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of *-1 precipitating another market crash .
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market 0 *T*-1 to trade since Friday 's 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street .
But rather than *-1 set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose *-1 to remain on the sidelines .
Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said 0 they were n't planning *-1 to unload U.S. or European equities .
`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is * to wait and see , '' said *T*-1 a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co .
`` We would like *-1 to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in *-2 to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation *ICH*-1 during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes *-3 to do just that .
But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt *-1 .
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66 , or 1.7 % , to 2600.88 .
The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
Declining issues swamped advancers , 941-105 .
But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares , compared with 574.7 million Friday .
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes .
A midmorning rebound brought it back *-1 to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low .
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 .
Many investors , trying * to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks .
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed *-1 by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .
Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's 22.6 % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % *T*-1 .
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening .
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 *-1 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
Nobuto Yasuda , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan .
`` Now we are looking for the time 0 * to place buy orders *T*-1 , '' he said *T*-2 .
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''
Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time 0 * to buy *T*-1 , as was the case *?* two years ago , '' he said *T*-2 .
`` Those shares which *T*-3 had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed *-1 with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned *-2 , there is n't much impact . ''
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine .
`` We have no plans *-2 to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said *T*-1 Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co .
He said 0 Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that Yasuda Trust plans for *T*-1 when it charts its overseas investment strategy *T*-2 .
Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % .
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .
Brokers and fund managers said 0 the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market .
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said *T*-1 William Au Yeung , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong .
`` Markets in this region are n't so geared *-1 to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''
Several analysts said 0 Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China .
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want *-2 to get out *T*-1 , they tend *-3 to go where the liquidity is *T*-4 , '' said *T*-5 Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .
She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who *T*-1 bailed out generally did so profitably .
Similarly , Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close .
In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 *-1 to finish at 2601.70 .
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 473.9 million Friday .
But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four-day closure after the 1987 crash .
Richard Chenevix-Trench , a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said 0 the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
`` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside , * not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said *T*-1 .
In Australia , Sydney 's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5 , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 .
But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday .
Nestor Hinzack , an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett , Buckeridge & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` sheep-like '' as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies 0 they perceived *T*-1 as *-2 having any takeover premium built into the price .
London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points .
The Financial Times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7 .
Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday .
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , * pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % .
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued *-1 to decline steeply for the next three months *T*-2 .
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as * calculated *-1 by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .
* To make them directly comparable , each index is based *-1 on the close of 1969 equaling 100 .
The percentage change is since year-end .
Frank Lloyd Wright is reported *-1 to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California .
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting *-2 to overwhelm the forces that *T*-1 made it such a significant place .
What else is one *-1 to make *T*-2 of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed * by several major environmental groups and organized * by the state 's attorney general ?
If *-2 passed *-1 by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought * to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed * with a $ 40 million *U* budget 0 * to sue any firm or agency 0 he thinks 0 *T*-4 is being too dirty *T*-3 .
The initiative is based *-1 largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment .
Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with this one .
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops *ICH*-2 in California that *T*-1 do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have *-1 to adjust or give up the California market .
In other words , California is presuming *-1 to take control of the nation 's farm policy .
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected *-1 from scientific reality .
* Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it *EXP*-1 is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what *T*-3 is billed *-2 as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing 0 * to do *T*-2 with the new environment initiative , what *T*-1 is going on ?
The first place 0 * to look *T*-1 under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit *T*-2 .
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .
He 's running for governor .
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who *T*-2 collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative 0 *T*-3 to be placed *-1 on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .
That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .
The initiative seems *-3 to have been crafted *-4 *-5 to include all the hot issues that *T*-1 set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who *T*-2 donate money .
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits *T*-1 -RRB- is gravy .
This initiative is being labeled *-1 The Big Green , but maybe it should be called *-2 The Big Greenback .
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , *-1 sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-
While it *ICH*-3 is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled *-5 unconstitutional , it *EXP*-4 is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through .
This is the state that *T*-1 recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer 0 *T*-3 to sue companies or government agencies that *T*-1 do things 0 he does n't like *T*-2 .
That means 0 the NRDC and such groups no longer would have *-1 to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue *ICH*-1 among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want *-2 to be the President who *T*-1 lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California .
And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start *-1 to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered * to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led * to wherever its la-la activists want *-2 to take it *T*-1 .
First , there was a death watch .
Then exhilaration .
*-1 Spurred *-2 by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , *-1 gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 .
It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash .
While the advance cheered investors who *T*-1 feared 0 a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed * by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that *T*-1 includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98 .
Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash .
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which *T*-2 each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after *-4 being suspended *-1 Friday afternoon *T*-3 .
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7\/8 to 222 7\/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .
Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said 0 *T*-1 Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure *ICH*-1 of the OTC market * to get into plus territory .
It 's just a strange feeling .
I do n't think 0 anyone left the place *-1 whistling Dixie . ''
The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration *ICH*-1 of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 .
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left * over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout .
At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3\/4 to 117 .
The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed *-1 for yet another big tumble .
More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of * keeping the market orderly groped *-1 to find buy orders from major brokerage firms 0 *T*-2 to match the selling flood .
Then , * to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , *-1 hammering stocks into steeper losses .
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures *-1 to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks *T*-1 .
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
They did n't *?* .
The Dow accelerated its slide , *-1 losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started *-1 to rebound , and when it shot upward *T*-2 it did so even faster than the early-morning fall .
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who *T*-1 were responsible .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started *-1 buying stocks heavily .
The program traders were in there , too , of course .
But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions .
Roland M. Machold , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which *T*-1 oversees $ 29 billion *U* in investments , said 0 the `` first thing 0 we did *T*-2 was * to double our orders '' yesterday morning .
`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million *U* and put it in '' the market .
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that *T*-1 could n't finish trading that day .
The stock opened late at 114 1\/2 , down 8 1\/2 .
But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said 0 *T*-1 .
However , Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said : `` I would be surprised *-1 if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ''
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved *-1 that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock .
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : `` I think 0 the opening was constructive .
It was orderly .
We put some orders together .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart *T*-1 . ''
Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum .
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 .
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval .
Grinned *ICH*-1 Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , 0 this market acts *-2 healthy . ''
Around him , scores of traders seemed *-1 to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water *-2 to cool them off .
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` * Pull your offers '' -- * meaning that specialists soon expected *-1 to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said *T*-1 one Big Board specialist .
But not everybody was making money .
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted *-1 Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came *T*-2 they were frozen *-1 with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers *-1 to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed *-2 , slaughtered *-2 , '' said *T*-1 one Chicago-based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks *T*-1 mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .
James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million *U* and get the program rally started *-1 .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
Then when the market was at a technical level 0 * to buy *T*-1 *T*-2 , they came in with a vengeance . ''
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said *T*-1 Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who *T*-1 work with them .
Specialists were criticized *-1 for their inability * to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge .
But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said 0 *T*-2 Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who *T*-1 had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy .
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been spared *-1 during the past two days ' gyrations .
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned *-1 in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
For example , Halliburton jumped 3 1\/4 to 38 , Schlumberger rose 2 1\/2 to 43 1\/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1\/8 to 22 .
Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , *-1 rising 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/4 on nearly eight million shares .
Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares .
Shares of International Business Machines , which *T*-1 reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after *-2 slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years .
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .
Merrill Lynch added 1 3\/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 .
Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares .
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for *-1 triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months .
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded * in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated *-1 *T*-2 , were program-related , he said 0 *T*-3 .
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something 0 you would say 0 *T*-1 precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said 0 *T*-2 .
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
`` Obviously , every time 0 we get this kind of reaction *T*-2 , it 's going *-3 to make everybody *ICH*-1 nervous , including me , '' he said *T*-4 .
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . ''
Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who *T*-1 were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors .
`` The institutions ca n't be criticized *-1 for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said *T*-2 in an interview .
`` It was the opposite of what *T*-1 happened on Oct. 19 .
They used their judgment .
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which *T*-1 kept the market orderly .
Maybe they learned from experience . ''
Mr. Phelan said 0 the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded * during the day only seven *T*-1 were closed *-2 and were n't reopened *-2 before the close .
`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said *T*-1 of the specialists .
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions .

A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .
The exemption allowed * on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears *-2 to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which *T*-1 has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
By a 6-4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .
But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to *-1 in subsequent discussions .
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered *-1 as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who *T*-1 has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman *-2 to garner votes for the initiative .
The measure is attached *-1 to the more than $ 26 billion *U* fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced *-2 with more than $ 205 million *U* in road projects earmarked * by members as well as funds sought * by major airports , including Denver .
From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy * to follow *T*-1 .
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina .
Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference *-1 to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed * by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who *T*-1 had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
`` Anybody can vote as they want *?* , '' said *T*-1 Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees .
`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ''
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises *-1 to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion *U* -- a 12 % boost .
The facilities account includes $ 40 million *U* for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental .
*-1 Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought *-1 to gain leverage over the city of Denver .
Texas Air Corp. , which *T*-1 owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought *-2 to impose conditions that *T*-1 would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates .
But this was rejected *-2 in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department *-1 to review the costs of the first phase , expected * to cost about $ 2 billion *U* .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed *-1 to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million *U* in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
The sum is more than double what the House had approved *T*-2 for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut *-1 by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
Congress previously cut six airports this year .
The impact of the changes is * to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 *U* for each passenger in subsidies *T*-1 .
Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million *U* for Amtrak , including $ 85 million *U* for capital improvements .
And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen *-1 at $ 1.625 billion *U* , or $ 20 million more *U* than last fiscal year .

Sony Corp. , which *T*-1 has offered *-2 to acquire the movie-production company , is seeking *-3 to free its top executives , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
Sony two weeks ago agreed *-1 to acquire Columbia for $ 3.4 billion *U* , or $ 27 *U* a share .
Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week ; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued , *-2 charging Warner with * attempting *-1 to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of the two companies .
Guber-Peters 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million *U* , or 62 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
The company said 0 revenue rose 138 % , to $ 10.9 million *U* from $ 4.6 million *U* , * reflecting the success of its movies `` Gorillas in the Mist '' and `` Rainman , '' as well as the box-office smash `` Batman .
A group including Jon M. Huntsman of Salt Lake City , said 0 it boosted its stake in Aristech Chemical Corp. to 8.36 % of the the common shares outstanding .

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Huntsman group said 0 it controls 2,720,675 Aristech common shares , including 306,000 shares bought * from Aug. 21 to Oct. 13 for $ 20 to $ 20.875 *U* per share .
Officials at Aristech , based * in Pittsburgh , declined comment .
Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for * not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready *-1 to send its own version of a CARE package .

Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . ''
The Poles might do better *-1 to view it as a Trojan Horse .

Waterford Wedgwood PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts -LRB- $ 14.9 million *U* -RRB- from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier .
The results for the half were worse than market expectations , which *T*-1 suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts .
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday , Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- .
The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts , compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period .
There were n't any extraordinary items .
Sales for the total group rose 27 % to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago .
Waterford has decided against *-1 paying an interim dividend .
Waterford said 0 the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected *-1 to enhance the company 's long-term prospects .
The sudden `` flight to quality '' that *T*-2 triggered Friday 's explosive bond-market rally was reversed *-1 yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted *T*-1 , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking .
`` It was a pretty wild day .
Our markets were closely tied *-1 to the stock market , '' said *T*-4 Joel Kazis , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
`` Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed *-2 once the stock market found its legs , '' he said *T*-3 .
Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday .
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds , which *T*-1 are safer than other types of securities .
But when stocks began *-2 to climb instead *T*-1 , prices of Treasury bonds declined .
Contributing to the selling pressure were *T*-2 dispatches by several investment firms advising clients *-1 to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
Among the firms were *T*-1 Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
The bond market seemed *-1 to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by *-2 allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % .
The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % .
The rate is considered *-1 an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
Traders said 0 yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected *-1 .
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .
Others note that some investors were disappointed *-1 because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3\/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount .
The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities .
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday .
The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted *-1 late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % Friday .
Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
But prices of junk bonds , which *T*-2 were battered *-1 Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded *-3 to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
Some traders said 0 the high-yield market was helped *-1 by active institutional buying .
In particular , they said 0 *T*-1 , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began *-2 making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels *T*-3 .
`` I think 0 the willingness *ICH*-1 of securities companies * to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said *T*-2 John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which *T*-1 opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT .
The benchmark 30-year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the Tokyo stock market .
But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
Many U.S. trading operations , wanting * to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin *T*-2 , were fully staffed *-1 during the Tokyo trading session .
`` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said *T*-1 Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank .
Jay Goldinger , who *T*-1 often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said 0 trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile .
`` We went down 3\/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3\/4 point in 12 minutes , '' he said *T*-1 .
In Tokyo , trading is halted *-1 during lunchtime .
Tokyo 's market turned out *-1 to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading .
When the market opened here *T*-1 , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength .
The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong *ICH*-2 yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which *T*-1 includes the government 's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production .
Industrial production is expected *-1 to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report .
The August trade deficit is expected *-1 to have widened to $ 9.1 billion *U* from $ 7.58 billion *U* in July .
A widening of that magnitude , said 0 *T*-1 one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... .
It could do damage to us . ''
Meanwhile , agency supply is expected *-1 to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ 2.3 billion *U* offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and 10-year maturities *T*-2 .
Tomorrow , the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue , which *T*-1 is expected *-2 to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion *U* and carry a maturity greater than 20 years .
Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp. , the new federal agency created * *-1 to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts .
And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans *-1 to price a $ 3 billion *U* offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15 years .
`` There 's lots of supply , '' the New York trader said *T*-1 .
`` We have a couple or three tough weeks coming . ''
Treasury Securities

The latest 10-year notes were quoted *-1 late at 100 3\/32 for a yield of 7.97 % , compared with 101 9\/32 0 * to yield 7.84 % *T*-2 .

The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 .
The average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six-month bills , the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on July 31 , 1989 .
Here are auction details :
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365-day year .
Both issues are dated *-1 Oct. 19 .

Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.39 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42 .

Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were *T*-2 continued heavy sales by mortgage originators , which *T*-1 are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates .
There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market .
Municipals
Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1\/4 to 3\/4 point lower in late dealings .
The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally *T*-1 .
Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying *-1 to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness .
Tax-exempts started the session *-1 flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n't at hand .
Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session .
Traders said 0 retail investors seemed *-1 to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market .

A spokesman for Laidlaw declined *-2 to disclose the price 0 the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid *T*-1 for the additional shares , which he said 0 *T*-3 were acquired `` over the last couple of weeks . ''
The spokesman said 0 Laidlaw would n't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30 % `` without a great deal of thought '' because of British takeover regulations that *T*-1 require a company acquiring more than 30 % to extend an offer to the rest of the company 's shareholders .
ADT , a security services and auctions company , trades on London 's Stock Exchange .
Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd. , a Montreal transportation , resources and industrial holding concern .

Export sales for leisure items alone , for instance , totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months , up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year .
Domestic leisure sales , however , were lower .

The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems , based * in Ambler , Pa. , reported a nine-month net loss of $ 2.43 million *U* compared with net income of $ 2.71 million *U* , or 44 cents a share , for the nine-month period a year earlier .

What *T*-1 does n't belong here ?
A. manual typewriters , B. black-and-white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows .
If you guessed black-and-white snapshots , you 're right .
After years of * fading into the background , two-tone photography is coming back .
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
Portrait studios accustomed * to * shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders .
And black-and-white photography classes are crowded with students .
What *T*-1 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done * entirely in black and white .
And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred * , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films .
`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says *T*-1 Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division .
Until two years ago , sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s .
But last year , *-1 buoyed *-2 by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected *-3 to jump at least that much again this year .
Photographic companies are scrambling *-1 to tap the resurging market , *-1 reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones .
At Kodak , which *T*-1 largely ignored the market for years , black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion *U* in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began *-1 marketing T-Max 3200 , one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films .
*-1 Aimed *-3 at commercial photographers , the film can be used *-1 in very low light without * sacrificing quality , says 0 *T*-2 Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter .
Also trying *-1 to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion-a-year *U* industry is *T*-2 Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG .
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that *T*-1 's geared *-2 to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers .
*-1 Slated *-3 for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced *-1 a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says 0 *T*-2 an Agfa spokesman .
The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely *-1 to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known * in the industry for its premium products .
Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much .
`` We hope 0 the trend lasts , '' says *T*-1 Laurie DiCara , Ilford 's marketing communications director .
Why all the interest ?
For baby boomers who *T*-2 grew up *-3 being photographed *-1 in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic .
`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says *T*-1 Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology .
`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds 0 *T*-1 .
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who *T*-1 have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls .
* Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign *T*-1 features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T-shirts .
Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says 0 Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted *-1 to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says *T*-2 , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and automobiles , which *T*-1 have long depended on color , are making the switch .
Companies `` feel 0 black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says 0 *T*-2 Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who *T*-1 is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine .
Other companies that *T*-1 are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc .
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend .
*-2 Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says 0 *T*-1 John Perrin .
His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says 0 *T*-1 , is booked *-2 solid for the next five .
One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says 0 she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
It is n't ordinary like color . ''
Still , most consumers are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras *-1 to take family snapshots .
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore .
Typically , it must be mailed *-1 to a handful of processors and may take a week or more *-1 to be processed and returned *-2 .
Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
But for photofinishers , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher .
Some companies are starting *-1 to tackle that problem .
Ilford , for example , recently introduced a black-and-white film that *T*-2 can be processed *-1 quickly by color labs .
*-1 Intent on *-2 wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes .
Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , *-1 offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes .
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video *ICH*-1 to processors on how * to develop its monochrome film more efficiently *T*-2 .
Other companies are introducing related products .
Charles Beseler Co. , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted * at teen-agers who *T*-1 want *-2 to process their own black-and-white photographs .
The kit , which *T*-2 has a suggested retail price of $ 250 *U* and has already become a bestseller , was introduced *-1 after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment .
`` It seems 0 computers as hobbies have waned , '' says *T*-1 Ian Brightman , Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer .
But some industry observers believe 0 the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says *T*-1 Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute .
`` The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago .
You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made * for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary *T*-1 , all were black and white .
`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says *T*-1 Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America .
`` That 's the appeal .
McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said 0 improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a 21 % gain in third-quarter profit to $ 8.8 million *U* , or 31 cents a share , from $ 7.2 million *U* , or 25 cents a share .
Sales rose more than 7 % to $ 94.9 million *U* from $ 88.3 million *U* .
The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed at $ 25.25 *U* a share , down 25 cents .
Agip S.p . A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer * to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A .
The price was n't disclosed *-1 .
A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer , submitted * last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted * last week .
Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused *-1 to identify the bidding companies .
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers *ICH*-2 are expected *-1 from other companies within two weeks .
Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets .
While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little-known indicator that *T*-1 has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
The barometer , developed * by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which *T*-1 uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .
In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since *-1 reaching a high early this year .
Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says 0 *T*-1 Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .
*-2 A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that *T*-1 decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end *T*-3 .
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely *T*-1 .
`` No meeting is scheduled *-1 because the expansion shows no sign of * going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports *T*-2 .
* Based *-1 largely on the recent strength in their index , called * the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
Underlying this optimism is *T*-1 the index 's longstanding ability * to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be *?* , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components *T*-1 include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved *T*-2 , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that *T*-1 ushered in the Great Depression .
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to *RNR*-1 and through *RNR*-1 the crash .
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing *T*-1 now , '' Mr. Moore says *T*-2 .
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index , which *T*-1 is not a part of the Commerce index .
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged .
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted * for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .
Notably absent from the Columbia index is *T*-2 the stock market , which Mr. Moore says 0 `` *T*-1 is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for * anticipating some short-run twists and turns . ''
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as * reflected *-3 in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated *-1 by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that *T*-2 then made up the Commerce index .
It was assigned *-1 a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .
The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim 0 *T*-1 , because of the growing impact of international developments .
`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied * to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says *T*-1 , *-2 citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .
He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said 0 it agreed *-1 to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .
The value of the acquisition was n't disclosed *-1 .
The move is in line with BSN 's strategy of * gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth .
BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern .
The French group has an agreement giving it the right * to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed *-1 within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said 0 *T*-2 .
The takeover was submitted *-1 for approval by the West German cartel office , BSN said 0 *T*-2 .
Birkel is West Germany 's second-biggest producer of pasta , with sales of 250 million marks -LRB- $ 133.4 million *U* -RRB- in 1988 .
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany , and is that nation 's leading producer of pasta sauces .
The acquisition strengthens BSN 's position in the European pasta market .
The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy , whose sales *T*-1 are chiefly in the Italian market .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it reduced its rating on $ 281 million *U* of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , *-1 saying 0 it believes 0 bondholders will recover only `` negligible principal . ''

Moody 's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B-3 .
The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa .
The rating agency said 0 about $ 85 million *U* in securities was affected *-1 .
The downgrades were prompted *-1 , Moody 's said 0 *T*-2 , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock .
Moody 's also said 0 it believed 0 the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if * completed *-1 , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position .
THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , *-1 spurred *-2 by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .
The Dow Jones industrials closed up 88.12 points , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after *-1 being down as much as 63.52 points in the morning .

Intel , based * in Santa Clara , Calif. , is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that *T*-1 forms the heart of IBM-compatible personal computers .
Under the agreement , Intel will invest $ 3 million *U* *-1 to acquire a 4 % stake in Alliant , a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers .
Alliant , based * in Littleton , Mass. , will license its parallel-computing technologies to Intel , * providing users a way 0 * to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously *T*-1 .

An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia .
This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over *T*-1 in the expectation that it 's going *-2 to hold an election .
The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels .
The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged * with *-1 overseeing the election 's fairness , Bryan O'Linn , was openly sympathetic to SWAPO .
Shortly after that , Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested *-1 and his passport confiscated *-2 .
Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued * by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which *T*-1 made it *EXP*-2 a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election commission .
The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts *-2 running the government *T*-1 .
To the extent 0 Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus *ICH*-1 of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa .
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in
Last year , the U.S. brokered a peace settlement * to remove Cuba 's `` Afrika Korps '' from Angola and hold `` free and fair '' elections that *T*-1 would end South Africa 's control of Namibia .
The elections are set *-1 for Nov. 7 .
In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service , visited Namibia *-1 to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign .
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn , head of a commission charged * with *-1 investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court .
After Mr. Stanley 's article was published *-1 in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer .
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged *-1 along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month *T*-2 .
Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley 's detention .
Mr. Stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that *T*-1 threaten *-2 to derail Namibia 's elections .
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters .
The U.S. is in the habit of * arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results .
It now has the chance * to redress that record in Namibia .
State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released *-1 and that the United Nation 's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides .
Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday .
Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness .
Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , *-1 rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that *T*-2 had been supporting prices appeared *-3 to be solved *-1 .
Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , *-1 ending with a small net loss .
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .
Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork .
In commodity markets yesterday : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , *-1 first falling and then later rising .
Silver performed quietly .
The spot October gold price rose $ 4 *U* to $ 367.30 *U* an ounce .
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 *U* an ounce at $ 371.20 *U* , after *-1 trading as high as $ 374 *U* .
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163 *U* .
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , *-1 easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer 0 it was *T*-1 two years ago on Black Monday .
For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive , so it could n't react to it .
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 *U* to as high as $ 471.60 *U* , and the more deferred positions , due * to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 *U* .
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract tacked on further gains , *-1 rising to as high as $ 491.50 *U* for a gain of almost $ 20 *U* on top of the Friday advances , before *-2 giving up almost $ 10 *U* of that at the close .
Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 *U* was miniscule compared with that .
One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said 0 the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that *T*-1 would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .
`` What the stock market did *T*-1 was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened *?* , '' said *T*-2 Mr. Cardillo .
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said 0 *T*-1 .
He expects a drop in interest rates , which *T*-1 would help gold by *-2 keeping the dollar from *-3 rising .
Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected *-1 in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released *-2 today *T*-3 .
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said 0 *T*-1 .
ENERGY :
*-1 Worried that Friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things 0 *T*-2 to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .
The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 *U* a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents .
Some analysts said 0 crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains .
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what *T*-1 dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed *-1 up on expectations that world oil demand will continue *-2 to be strong .
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .
So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well .
Indeed , after *-1 reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday .
COPPER :
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that *T*-2 had been underpinning prices appeared *-3 to be solved *-1 .
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 *U* .
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word *ICH*-1 spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst .
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which *T*-1 recently began *-2 seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank .
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company .
Now , the analyst said 0 *T*-3 , only minor points remain *-1 to be cleaned *-2 up .
`` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears *-2 to have been achieved *-3 , '' he said *T*-1 .
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons .
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons .
The LME stocks decline was about as * expected *-1 , but the Comex gain was n't *?* .
However , this was brushed *-1 aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said 0 *T*-2 .
At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 *U* , but it was n't able *-1 to sustain the gain .
`` It was simply overbought , '' he said 0 *T*-2 , and selling by funds that *T*-1 are computer guided helped *-3 depress prices .
COTTON :
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market .
The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound , at 74.48 cents .
Technical considerations following the hurricane , which *T*-1 was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said 0 *T*-2 Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York .
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which *T*-1 is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area .
However , after *-1 absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began *-1 to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said 0 *T*-2 .
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said 0 *T*-1 .
Colder weather *ICH*-3 is being predicted *-1 for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said 0 *T*-2 .
That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added 0 *T*-1 .
SUGAR :
Futures prices declined .
The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents .
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered *T*-1 , but the price then fell back .
A price-depressing factor , one analyst said 0 *T*-2 , was that India , which *T*-1 had been expected *-3 to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases .
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected *-1 to buy more , the analyst said 0 *T*-2 .
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market .
`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said *T*-1 Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
At any rate , she added 0 *T*-1 , `` India needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later *-2 to buy it . ''

The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough *-2 to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which *T*-1 would hurt demand for beef and pork .

Knight-Ridder Inc. said 0 it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter , * contrary to reported analysts ' comments that the publishing company 's earnings would be down .
A company spokesman said 0 he believed 0 the confusion was caused *-1 when James Batten , Knight-Ridder 's chairman and chief executive , told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder 's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would `` be behind a little bit '' from like period of *T*-2
The Knight-Ridder spokesman said 0 the third-quarter earnings that the company plans *-1 to report *T*-2 Oct. 24 are expected *-3 to be up .
The spokesman said 0 he was `` comfortable '' with revised analysts ' projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents *U* a share , compared with the 53 cents a share 0 it reported *T*-1 for the 1988 third quarter .
Knight-Ridder said 0 it agreed with estimates that net income for all of 1989 would be around $ 2.86 *U* a share , compared with $ 2.59 *U* a share a year earlier .

Herbert M. Sandler , chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland , Calif. , savings-and-loan holding company , credited the high number of loans added * to the company 's portfolio over the last 12 months for *-1 broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance .

In savings activity , Mr. Sandler said 0 consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989 , and topped $ 11 billion *U* at quarter 's end for the first time in the company 's history .

Whirlpool Corp. , Benton Harbor , Mich. , said 0 it has developed a process * to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that *T*-1 previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers .
The maker of home appliances said 0 the process , which *T*-1 involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs 0 *T*-2 to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring .
Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere .
CFCs are widely used *-1 as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants .
But their use has been linked *-1 to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking *-2 to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance .
Whirpool said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture .
Maxus Energy Corp. , Dallas , said 0 it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia .
Maxus said 0 it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells 0 it drilled *T*-2 in the field , which *T*-1 is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field , because the wells are similar to others drilled * at its Intan and Widuri fields .

For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday *-2 to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed *-1 to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity .
Many went bargain-hunting .
Among those sighing with relief was *T*-2 John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who *T*-1 took to the firm 's trading floor *-3 to monitor yesterday 's events .
As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back .
At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself .
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers .
By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles *T*-1 had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened .
But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began *-1 to turn around .
It ended with a gain of 88.12 points .
By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record .
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 .
But the rally was largely confined *-3 to the blue-chip stocks , which *T*-2 had been hard hit *-1 during Friday 's selling frenzy .
Overall , more Big Board stocks *ICH*-1 lost money than * gained *?* .
And many arbitragers , already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed *T*-1 .
Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points , its second-worst drop in history .
World-wide , trading was generally manageable .
The Frankfurt stock exchange *ICH*-2 was hardest hit *-1 of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % .
In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading .
Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit *-1 harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no free-fall declines .
Investors big and small say 0 they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected *-1 .
What *T*-1 's more , such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling .
Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . ''
In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who *T*-1 owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees .
`` I look at it as a ho-hum matter , '' he says *T*-1 .
Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback .
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness * to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .
Foreign stock markets , which *T*-1 kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts .
The dollar , after *-1 falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , * thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks .
And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors .
Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready *-2 to buy some of the blue chips 0 they felt 0 *T*-3 had been sharply undervalued *-1 on Friday .
Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system 0 *T*-1 to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's .
`` There is too much complacency , '' says *T*-1 money manager Barry Schrager .
Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed *-1 around the globe .
So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start *T*-1 .
The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading .
But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , * closing down 647 .
Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose *-1 to sit this calamity out .
In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process .
Clients `` are all staying out '' of the market , one Merrill trader says 0 *T*-1 .
The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe .
Frankfurt 's opening was delayed *-1 a half hour because of a crush of sell orders .
`` The beginning was chaotic , '' says *T*-1 Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank
In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling .
A computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one *-2 red when its price is falling *T*-1 .
The screen was a sea of red .
`` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , '' says *T*-2 J. Francis Palamara , a New Yorker who *T*-1 runs the 15-trader office .
London 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , *-1 sending an encouraging message to Wall Street .
When trading opened in New York *T*-1 at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as * expected *-2 .
Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting 0 the Dow would fall by about 60 points .
With sell orders *ICH*-1 piled *-2 up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time .
By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points .
By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 .
Ten minutes later , the Dow hit bottom - down 63.52 points , another 2.5 % .
But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's sharpest traders say , 0 they sensed a turn .
`` The first thing that *T*-1 caught my eye that *T*-2 was encouraging was 0 Treasury bonds were off , '' says *T*-3 Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price .
`` It meant that people were n't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds . ''
Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed * *-1 to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward .
Stock traders were buoyed *-1 -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday .
`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted *T*-1 a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
Shearson 's London trading room went wild .
Traders shouted out as their Reuters , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street .
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted *T*-1 Shearson 's Andy Rosen .
`` This is panic buying . ''
Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally .
Japanese were said *-1 to be heavy buyers .
German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co .
Then , traders say 0 *T*-1 , corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear , * triggering gains in , among other issues , Alcan Aluminium and McDonald 's .
Walt Disney Co. , which *T*-1 had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that *T*-2 halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at 114.5 , down 8.5 .
But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said 0 *T*-1 .
By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , * prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors .
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` * Pull your offers '' -- *-2 meaning that specialists soon expected *-1 to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said *T*-1 one Big Board specialist .
`` What we had *T*-1 was a real , old-fashioned rally . ''
This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed * *-1 to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods .
Typical , perhaps , was *T*-1 Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron .
Mr. LeBaron , who *T*-1 manages $ 10 billion *U* , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed *-3 to do *T*-2 . ''
*-2 Asked *-3 what stocks the computer bought *T*-1 , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . ''
Not everybody was making money .
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted *-1 Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came *T*-2 they were frozen *-1 with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers *-1 to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed *-2 , slaughtered *-2 , '' said *T*-1 one Chicago-based options trader .
Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day .
Charles Clough , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , says 0 bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow .
Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected *-1 to rattle traders .
Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying .
The market closed minutes after * reaching its high for the day of
Across the country , many people took yesterday 's events in stride , while *-1 remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general .
Says *ICH*-1 James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks .
I much prefer money 0 I can put my hands on *T*-1 . ''
While Mayor Norman found the market 's performance Monday reassuring , he says 0 *T*-1 , he remains uneasy .
`` We have half the experts saying one thing *RNR*-3 and half the other '' *RNR*-3 about the course of the economy .
Ralph Holzfaster , a farmer and farm-supply store operator in Ogallala , Neb. , says of the last few days events , `` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . ''
Says Gordon Fines , a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis , `` You 're on a roller coaster , and that may last .
The public is still cautious .
Skipper 's Inc. , Bellevue , Wash. , said 0 it signed a definitive merger agreement for a National Pizza Corp. unit to acquire the 90.6 % of Skipper 's Inc. 0 it does n't own *T*-1 for $ 11.50 *U* a share , or about $ 28.1 million *U* .
NP Acquisition Co. , a National Pizza unit , plans *-1 to begin a tender offer for Skipper 's on Friday , conditioned on at least two-thirds of Skipper 's shares being tendered * .

National Pizza said 0 it settled its dispute with Pizza Hut , * allowing it to make the purchase .
Also , Skipper 's results began *-1 to turn around , * permitting a higher offer , National Pizza said 0 *T*-2 .
For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3 , Skipper 's had net income of $ 361,000 *U* , or 13 cents a share , compared with a net loss a year earlier .
Revenue was $ 19.9 million *U* .

A spokesman said 0 the company had sales of $ 400 million *U* in 1988 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , West Point-Pepperell fell 25 cents to $ 53.875 *U* .
Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends *-1 to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion *U* in good will realized * in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc .
Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to * reincorporating the world 's biggest employment-services group in the U.S. .
Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected * within a few months , as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5 % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings .
The name change and good will write-off could help *-1 solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January .
`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. Fromstein said *T*-1 .
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil .
`` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said *T*-1 Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York .
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added 0 *T*-1 .
In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ 1 million-a-year *U* chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower .
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by *-1 taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .
But the Blue Arrow tumult is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million *U* -LRB- $ 39.4 million *U* -RRB- loan which Mr. Fromstein has said 0 *T*-2 was made *-1 under Mr. Berry 's direction .
Blue Arrow was able *-1 to pull off the $ 1.34 billion *U* takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able *-1 to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion *U* in good will arising from the purchase .
*-1 As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have *-1 to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , * creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held * in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said *T*-1 .
The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion *U* of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written *-1 off . ''
Mr. Fromstein said 0 he hopes *-1 to eradicate some of the good will left * on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .
People close to Blue Arrow suggested 0 the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming 0 prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will .
That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after *-2 sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said 0 *T*-1 Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .
Overall , pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million *U* in the quarter from # 18.98 million *U* a year earlier .
Richard G. Sim , the man credited * with *-2 transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes *-1 to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp .
The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures 0 it will be easier this time .
But analysts , while *-1 applauding the acquisition , say 0 Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in * integrating the two companies .
Barry Wright , acquired * by Applied for $ 147 million *U* , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems .
The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .
Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million *U* , including $ 815,000 *U* from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million *U* .
Besides *-2 spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which *T*-1 were $ 201.7 million *U* in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line .
`` The question is how long it 's going *-1 to take Barry Wright *T*-2 *-4 to make a contribution , '' says *T*-3 F. John Mirek , an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee .
The answer will help *-1 determine whether Applied continues *-2 to reach the ambitious goals set * by Mr. Sim .
The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 *U* a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share *U* price by 1992 .
Strong earnings growth helped *-1 achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 .
The stock has since softened , *-1 trading around $ 25 *U* a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 *U* in national over-the-counter trading .
But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 *U* a share by the end of
* Reaching that goal , says 0 *T*-1 Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .
In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one 0 he faced *T*-1 when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 *T*-2 .
Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .
While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says 0 *T*-1 .
Mr. Sim is confident that the drive * to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has *?* at Applied .
He also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor 0 *T*-4 to develop a corporate culture that *T*-2 rewards managers who *T*-3 produce and where decision-making is shared *-1 *T*-5 .
Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in * moving into markets that *T*-1 have n't interested larger competitors .
`` With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , '' Mr. Sim says *T*-1 .
Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts 0 *T*-1 .
Mr. Sim figures 0 it will be easier * to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat .
When he came to Applied *T*-1 , `` I did n't have the power * to execute as I do today , '' he says 0 *T*-2 .
He was named *-1 chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .
At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective .
He took the company public in an offering that *T*-1 netted Applied about $ 12.6 million *U* , which *T*-2 helped *-3 launch the company 's acquisition program .
Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million *U* in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million *U* in fiscal 1985 .
The company expects that earnings , which *T*-1 have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ 20.8 million *U* , or $ 1.58 *U* a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million *U* in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million *U* in 1985 .
